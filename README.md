In a company, measuring business performance is crucial for tracking, monitoring, and evaluating the success or failure of various business processes. This project, business performance for an eCommerce company will be analyzed, taking into account several business metrics such as customer growth, product quality, and payment methods based on historical data from 2016 to 2018.

## Steps:
1. Create a new database and tables, paying attention to the data type of each column.
2. Import CSV data into database.
3. Create Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
4. Analyzing business performance into three aspect:
   - Annual Customer Growth Activity Analysis
   - Annual Product Category Quality Analysis
   - Annual Payment Type Usage Analysis
5. Create visualization of the result.

## Results:
1. Customer Activity Growth - The eCommerce business experienced significant growth in terms of average monthly active users, the number of new customer acquisitions, and total repeat orders from 2016 to 2017. However, the total number of customers making repeat orders reached its peak in 2017, and although it remained relatively high in 2018, there was no further change in average order frequency from 2016 to 2018. Further analysis may be needed to explore strategies to encourage more frequent purchases or expand the customer base in the future.
2. Product Category Quality - The business experienced significant total revenue growth from 2016 to 2018. This growth in total revenue indicates successful sales and overall business performance. On the other hand, the number of cancelled orders increased each year, reaching 334 in 2018. This trend suggests potential issues with product quality, customer service, or other factors that need to be addressed to reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction.
3. Payment Type Usage - These data indicate the popularity and usage trends of different payment types over the specified years. Credit cards were the most frequently used payment method, followed by boleto, voucher, and debit cards, with a small number of transactions falling into the "not defined" category.
